# Docker Configuration Summary

## Overview
We have been working on configuring and testing Docker containers for the GPT Researcher project. The main focus has been on ensuring proper port binding and container accessibility.

## Current Status
- Successfully built the Docker container using `docker build -t gpt-researcher .`
- Tested container with explicit port binding using `docker run -p 0.0.0.0:4593:4593 --env-file .env gpt-researcher`
- The API is now accessible at:
  - API documentation: http://localhost:4593/docs
  - API root endpoint: http://localhost:4593
  - Research endpoint: http://localhost:4593/research

## Key Configurations
1. Port Binding
   - Using explicit host binding with `-p 0.0.0.0:4593:4593`
   - This ensures the port is accessible from all network interfaces
   - Container port 4593 is properly mapped to host port 4593

2. Environment Variables
   - Using `--env-file .env` for configuration
   - Environment variables are properly loaded from the .env file

## Next Steps
- Modify docker-compose.yml to incorporate the same port binding configuration
- Test the complete setup using docker-compose
- Ensure production deployment uses the same standardized configuration

## Important Notes
- The explicit binding to 0.0.0.0 was key to resolving accessibility issues
- The configuration ensures consistent behavior across development and production environments
- All necessary environment variables should be properly configured in the .env file

## Testing Results
The API endpoints have been tested and are responding correctly:
- GET / returns 200 OK
- Documentation endpoint is accessible
- Research endpoint is properly configured for POST requests
